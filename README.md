# Linear-Piecewise-Map-Under-Stochastic-Perturbations
This repository contains Wolfram Mathematica code for studying phase portraits of a piecewise linear map with stochastic perturbations.
The model used is a generalization of the map studied by Robert L. Devaney in 1984 called ''Gingerbreadman''. This code has the possibility to study the deterministic version of the dynamics as well as the stochastic version.
